# Orange Telecom Dealer Prediction

This repository contains the project developed during my internship at Orange Telecom Maroc. The focus of this project is on predictive modeling to forecast stock breaks for dealers, helping to optimize inventory management and reduce stock shortages.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of stock breaks for Orange Telecom dealers. By analyzing historical data on dealer recharges, payments, and other key metrics, the model aims to provide actionable insights to improve supply chain efficiency.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:

- **Dealer Transactions**: Historical data on dealer recharges, including the amount, frequency, and type of payment.
- **Stock Information**: Data on stock levels, including any recorded stock breaks.
- **Additional Features**: Various other features that capture the behavior and performance of dealers over time.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Model**: A machine learning model trained on historical data to predict future stock breaks.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed analysis of the dataset to uncover important trends and patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of new features to improve the accuracy of the predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of different machine learning models to select the best one.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Orange-Telecom-Dealer-Prediction.git
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries by running:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Model**: Execute the notebook or script to train and evaluate the model.

## Results

The final model achieves [mention performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.] on the test set. It provides a valuable tool for Orange Telecom Maroc to anticipate and mitigate stock breaks.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of predictive analytics in optimizing inventory management and enhancing operational efficiency. The model can be further improved by incorporating more data and refining the feature set.
